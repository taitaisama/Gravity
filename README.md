# Gravity
A 2-D game written in java to simulate stars, planets and asteroids with different masses and speeds and watch as they move according to Newtonian gravity 

How to install:

On linux open terminal and type "sudo apt install default-jdk"
Afrer installing java, clone the .java files from this repo in a directory and compile them using javac \*.java
This will create .class files, after which you just need to run the file with the main function
This can be done by command java Gravity, which will run the application

How to play the game:

To add stars, planets and asteroids press the corrusponding buttons and enter the mass and speeds, stars dont have any speed and asteroids dont have any mass. Then click on the black screen to position the body and click again to specify the direction in which it will move. You can modify the colors, position, mass and speed of each body later as well by clicking on it and changing the parameters in the pop up. To zoom in and out use the scroll wheel and to move around use the arrow keys. The button clear removes every object and clear-off-screen removes every object that is outside the area you are viewing. The play/pause button stops/resumes time.
